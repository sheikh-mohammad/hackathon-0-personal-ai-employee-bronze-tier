# Personal AI Employee - Bronze Tier

This project implements a personal AI employee that monitors various sources (currently Gmail) and creates suggested replies and summaries in a vault directory and creates files for processing by human.

## Features

- Monitors Gmail for unread important emails
- Creates markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `Inbox` directory
- Tracks processed emails to prevent duplicates
- Automatically deletes processed files from `Inbox` after successful processing to `/Needs_Action` or `/Done`
- Handles OAuth authentication with Gmail API

```

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or if using uv:
uv sync
```

2. Download your Gmail API credentials from Google Cloud Console as `credentials.json` and place it in the root directory.

3. Authenticate with Gmail API:
```bash
python authenticate_gmail.py
```
Follow the prompts to authorize the application. This will create a `token.json` file.

4. Run the Gmail watcher:
```bash
python -m src.watchers.gmail_watcher
```

## Claude Code Integration

The system is designed to work with Claude Code following the Bronze Tier workflow:

1. **Gmail Watcher** monitors for new emails and creates raw email files in `Inbox` and action items in `Needs_Action`.
2. **Claude Code** processes the vault following the core loop (Read→Think→Write→Delete)
3. **Claude Runner** implements the specific processing logic according to Company_Handbook.md

## Changes Made

### Path Handling Improvements

1. **Improved path resolution**: Updated both `authenticate_gmail.py` and `src/watchers/gmail_watcher.py` to use proper path objects instead of relative strings, making the application more robust to different execution contexts.

2. **Corrected example usage**: Updated the default vault path in `src/watchers/gmail_watcher.py` to point to the dedicated `AI_Employee_Vault` directory.

3. **Enhanced file operations**: Used pathlib.Path methods like `unlink()` instead of `os.remove()` for safer file operations.

4. **Organized code structure**: Moved Python modules to `src/` directory with `base_watcher.py` in the main `src` folder and watchers in `src/watchers/` subdirectory.

## Architecture

- `BaseWatcher`: Abstract base class defining the interface for all watchers
- `GmailWatcher`: Implements Gmail monitoring functionality
- Suggested replies and summaries are created in YAML frontmatter format for easy parsing by AI systems

## Authentication Flow

The authentication script handles the OAuth2 flow and creates a `token.json` file that contains the user's access credentials. The token is refreshed automatically when needed.
